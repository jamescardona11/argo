## Quick Start

Import this library into your project:

```yaml
argo: ^latest_version
```

Add `ResponsiveWrapper` to your MaterialApp or CupertinoApp.
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ResponsiveWrapper(
        wrapConfig: WrapperConfig(
          globalBreakpoints: ScreenBreakpoints(
            mobile: 321,
            tablet: 650,
            desktop: 1100,
          ),
        ),
        child: Home(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Or Add `ResponsiveWrapper.builder` to your MaterialApp or CupertinoApp.
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: (context, child) => ResponsiveWrapper.builder(
        wrapConfig: WrapperConfig(
          globalBreakpoints: ScreenBreakpoints(
            mobile: 321,
            tablet: 650,
            desktop: 1100,
          ),
        ),
        builder: (ctx, themeDataRule) => child!,
      ),
      home: Home(),
    );
  }
}
```
That's it!
This widget allows to configurate the `WrapperConfig`.
You can make the manage for `Responsive Theme`

### ScreenBreakpoints
Are the control points that tells `ResponsiveWrapper` to change the `DeviceScreen`.
This is an upper or lower limit depends on how it is configured compared with `Size.width`.

Also it serves to do comparisons with the `Condition` class.
`SBValue` save a value that means `Size.width`.


## Responsive Widgets

### ResponsiveVisibility
Widget to show or hide a `child` depending of the `Condition`.
You can override the globalBreakpoints for localBreakpoints

```dart
ResponsiveVisibility.screen(
  conditionScreen: ConditionScreen(
    mobile: true,
    tablet: true,
    desktop: false,
  ),
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    width: 50,
    height: 50
  ),
),

```
You can change the condition type and improve the versatility of conditions with `ConditionBreakpoint`, and make result for VisibleWhen or HiddenWhen.

```dart
const List<ConditionBreakpoint<bool>> conditions = [
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.equals(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.mobile,
    value: true,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.smallerThan(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.desktop,
    value: true,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.equals(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.tablet,
    value: false,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.largerThan(
    value: true,
    breakpoint: 950,
  ),
];

ResponsiveVisibility.conditions(
  visibleWhen: conditions,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    width: 50,
    height: 50
  ),
),

```


### ResponsiveLayoutWidget

This widget show different widget depending of `screen` type, the condition configuration in `ResponsiveWrapper`, 
you can override the globalBreakpoints for localBreakpoints.

```dart
ResponsiveLayoutWidget(
  mobile: MobileChild(),
  tablet: TabletChild(),
  desktop: DesktopChild(),
)

```

In some moments you return and `RBuilder`, this typedef have the context and `ResponsiveInformation`.
With `ResponsiveInformation` allows change the basic structure and improve the versatility.

```dart
ResponsiveLayoutWidget.builder(
  mobile: (ctx, info) => MobileChild(),
  tablet: (ctx, info) => TabletChild(),
  desktop:(ctx, info) => DesktopChild(),
)

```


### ResponsiveBuilder

This generic widget to handle responsive builder, this widget return the context and `ResponsiveInformation`.
`ResponsiveInformation` is data class to handle `responsive` information for the widget.
ResponsiveInformation have orientation, localSize, ScreenSize, currentBreakpoints and `DeviceScreen`.

```dart
ResponsiveBuilder(
  builder: (ctx, info) { 
    if(info.localSize.width > 300 && info.deviceScreen.isTablet()){
      return Container(
                color: Colors.red,
                width: 50,
                height: 50
              );
    }else{
      return const SizedBox();
    }
  }
)

```



### OrientationLayoutBuilder

This widget is it create views depending of their `orientation`.
The widget is build with `RBuilder`, this typedef have the context and `ResponsiveInformation`.

```dart
OrientationLayoutBuilder(
  portrait: (ctx, info) => PortraitChild(),
  landscape: (ctx, info) => LandscapeChild(),
)

```


## TOOLS

### valueFromConditionByBreakpoints

You can get single value from `ConditionBreakpoint` List
It's goal is to have more modular conditions compared it with differents `breakpoint` we can use this to create more complex conditions. And you have three different construtors: 
`ConditionBreakpoint.equals` `ConditionBreakpoint.largerThan`, `ConditionBreakpoint.smallerThan`

```dart
const List<ConditionBreakpoint<bool>> conditions = [
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.equals(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.mobile,
    value: true,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.smallerThan(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.desktop,
    value: true,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.equals(
    screenType: DeviceScreen.tablet,
    value: false,
  ),
  ConditionBreakpoint<bool>.largerThan(
    value: true,
    breakpoint: 950,
  ),
];

final value = valueFromConditionByBreakpoints<bool>(
  context: context,
  condition: conditions,
  localBreakpoints: screenBreakpoints,
  defaultValue: true,
);

```

### valueFromConditionByBreakpoints

You can get single value from `ConditionScreen`,
It's goal is to have conditional value for the tree screen types `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`.

```dart
const condition = ConditionScreen(
  mobile: 'Apple',
  tablet: 'Orange',
  desktop: 'Watermelon',
);

final value = valueFromConditionByScreen<String>(
  context: context,
  condition: condition,
  localBreakpoints: screenBreakpoints,
  defaultValue: 'Lemon',
);

```

### ResponsiveContext Extension

You can get from the context info for make it easy the responsive apps

```dart
  context.widthPx = Returns same as MediaQuery.of(context).size.width
  context.heightPx = Returns same as MediaQuery.of(context).size.height
  context.theme = Getting Theme
  context.widthPct(10) = Returns percent (1-100) of screen width in pixels
  ...

```

### Responsive Theme 

Data class to handle the `theme responsive` information, this class may be used from `ResponsiveWrapper`
It's used from `ResponsiveWrapper` to get the value for the currentBreakpoints
Use differents `conditions` to store the themes.

The advantage is that you can create all the classes with `IThemeDataRule` for the configurations the app need.

It basic use:
```dart
ResponsiveTheme.screen(
   conditionScreen: ConditionScreen(
     mobile: MyThemesApp(),
     tablet: MyThemesTablet(),
     desktop: MyThemesWeb(),
   ),
 )
```

This is an example of a configuration:
```Dart


class MyThemesApp with IThemeDataRule {
  @override
  ThemeData getThemeByRule(ThemeRule rule) {
    switch (rule) {
      case ThemeRule.light:
        return lightTheme;
      case ThemeRule.dark:
        return darkTheme;
      case ThemeRule.custom:
        return darkerTheme;
      default:
        return lightTheme;
    }
  }
}

// This is a themeData for LightTheme is a normal object
final ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
    primaryColor: Colors.blueGrey,
    brightness: Brightness.light,
    textTheme: TextTheme(
      headline1: headline1.copyWith(fontSize: 26),
      headline2: headline2.copyWith(fontSize: 18),
    ),
  );


```
